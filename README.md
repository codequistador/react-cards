# Justin's Instructure Dev Homework

This is a simple React app built with HTML/CSS/JS and my limited knowledge of React. I did about 30 minutes of research on how to best do the API call in React (I used Axios for that. Good stuff!) and spent another 30 minutes planning my approach to this project.

Instead of using the drop-down button for the course descriptions (which would have made the cards jump all over with changing heights), I used a Material Design spec and created a "reveal" that overlays the card when the "more" icon is clicked.

I found Instructure's icon set and used it.
